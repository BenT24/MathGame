            <h3>Starting The Game</h3>
            <p>Click the button in the top left of this website that says "Create New Game". Once you do the game should
                show you a code. After that the person you are playing against should press the button that says
                "Join Game". Once that player does, the website should show to that person an input window in which
                he or she should type in the code that was shown to you.</p>
            <h3>Playing The Game</h3>
            <p>You will be given math problems, each of which should not take you too long to complete. As you solve
            these problems correctly, your vehicle will move forwards at the top of the screen. If, on the other hand
            you get problems wrong your vehicle will get moved backwards. The first vehicle that get to the finish
            line at the end of the race wins.</p>
